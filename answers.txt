What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A git merge will merge branches back to the main branch if your inside of it 
as it merges whatever branch you specify to the current branch, while git rebase
allows for you to change the current branch to a different commit.
Essentially merge will merge the off branch back to the main branch
while rebase changes the actual start of the branch.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a git repository that is not on your system but stored somewhere else 
and accessible from that platform, a great example of that is storing remote repositories in github. 
Other team members may be able to access that remote repository and add to it and it functions similarly 
to a normal local repo except that it can be pushed to and pulled from and you can copy the repository 
onto your desktop as a local repo using clone. Essentially allows for collaberation.

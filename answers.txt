What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a git repository that is not on your system but stored somewhere else 
and accessible from that platform, a great example of that is storing remote repositories in github. 
Other team members may be able to access that remote repository and add to it and it functions similarly 
to a normal local repo except that it can be pushed to and pulled from and you can copy the repository 
onto your desktop as a local repo using clone. Essentially allows for collaberation.

What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A git merge will merge branches back to the main branch if your inside of it 
as it merges whatever branch you specify to the current branch, while git rebase
allows for you to change the current branch to a different commit.
Essentially merge will merge the off branch back to the main branch
while rebase changes the actual start of the branch.
